The purpose of this project is to convert a spreadsheet containing names and phone numbers to a vcard file.
At altec, I'm provided a monthly spreadsheet of names and numbers and have to use that to updates our vcard file (containing roughly 350 individual contacts) manually
Today, we automate this to improve time wasted and insure the users always have an up-to-date list on contacts
