The purpose of this project is to convert a spreadsheet containing names and phone numbers to a vcard file.
A vcard is used upload contacts to cellphones. The format for these files are mostly standard besides apple.
For this reason, we have two scripts that do the exact same thing but the final output is modified to match
the format apple devices require.
